# Find Triplicate
Given a list of elements find an element that occurs (at least) three times.

Code currently includes only one algorithm for doing this:
* **TriplicateBruteForce**
  * Simple solution: Triple for-loop (brute force)
  * Time Complexity: O(n<sup>3</sup>)

## Task
Implement the ``ITriplicate`` interface. Write an algorithm which performs better than ``TriplicateBruteForce``.
To see if your algorithm is correct run ``TriplicateTest``.

Add your algorithm/class to the list of algorithms/classes in ``Main::main`` (line 39). Run ``Main`` to see how fast (or slow) your solution is compared to ``TriplicateBruteForce``.
What time complexity does your algorithm have?


## Expected output
```
---Generating Integer Lists---
10 lists generated with 10 000 elements each.

---Processing Algorithms---
TriplicateBruteForce        | time elapsed: 2826194217 microseconds (2826,194217 seconds)
MyFantasticTriplicateFinder | time elapsed: ?????????? microseconds (??????????? seconds)
