# Find Triplet Duplicates
Given a list of elements find an element that occurs (at least) three times.

Code includes four different algorithms for doing this:
* **ContainsThreeSimple**
  * Simple solution: Triple for-loop (brute force)
  * Time Complexity: O(n<sup>3</sup>)
* **ContainsThreeFrequency**
  * For each element in list iterate through the rest of the list and record the frequency of this element. If it occurs >= 3 return true.
  * Time Complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* **ContainsThreeSorting**
  * Sorts the list of elements. Searches through the list and checks if it is equals to the next two elements in the list.
  * Time Complexity: O(nlog(n))
* **ContainsThreeHash**
  * Records the frequencies of all numbers in HashMap. Checks frequency of the given element with O(1) lookup time.
  * Time Complexity: O(n)
